COPY THIS TO CHATGPT - BACKEND IMPORT ERROR

CURRENT ERROR:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'routers'

PROBLEM:
The backend is failing to start because it can't import the `routers` module. This is a Python module path issue.

FILE STRUCTURE:

├── apps/
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── main.py              # FastAPI app
│   │   ├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies (fixed)
│   │   ├── db.py               # Database config (created)

│   │       └── reports.py      # Reports endpoints (created)
│   └── web/                    # Next.js frontend

WHAT'S WORKING:
- ✅ Python 3.11 installed
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully 
- ✅ Backend health endpoint works when started correctly
- ✅ Frontend shows "BACKEND NOT AVAILABLE" because backend won't start

WHAT'S BROKEN:
- ❌ Backend won't start due to import error
- ❌ PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax (Windows issue)
- ❌ Module import path is wrong

EXACT COMMANDS TO FIX:

1. Fix the import in main.py:
```python
# Change this line in apps/api/main.py:
from routers import reports

# To this:
from .routers import reports
```

2. Start backend from correct directory:
```powershell
cd apps\api
py -3.11 -c "import uvicorn; uvicorn.run('main:app', host='127.0.0.1', port=8000, log_level='info')"
```

3. Start frontend:
```powershell
cd apps\web
npm install
npm run dev
```

ALTERNATIVE - CREATE __init__.py FILES:
If the relative import doesn't work, create these files:
- `apps/api/__init__.py` (empty file)
- `apps/api/routers/__init__.py` (empty file)

TEST COMMANDS:
```powershell
# Test backend health
Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz

# Test reports endpoint  
Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:8000/reports
```

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Backend starts without import errors
- Frontend connects to backend
- No more "BACKEND NOT AVAILABLE" popup
- PDF upload should work

ENVIRONMENT:
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11 (working)
- PowerShell (doesn't support && syntax)
- FastAPI backend on port 8000
- Next.js frontend on port 3000

The core issue is the Python module import path. Fix that and everything should work.
